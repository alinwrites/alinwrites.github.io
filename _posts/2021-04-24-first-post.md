Hello world! This is my first post to this blog **alinwrites**. Yay!!!

![cat reading newspaper meme](https://media.makeameme.org/created/we-must-celebrate-ltpfj2.jpg)

I am still unsure about blogging; however, I'll do my best to post every so often. This site is still undergoing some minor fixes here and there as I experiment with the layout with my amateur coding skills.

In other news, my very [first article for The Geekiary](https://thegeekiary.com/ride-or-die-movie-review/94805) was posted yesterday.

As I look at tweets about the movie, I realize that *Ride or Die* is a bit controversial with many people feeling disappointment at the movie's portrayal of a lesbian relationship. Indeed, I am inclined to agree that it is not necessarily the best representation of lesbian relationships.

However, knowing that the movie was based off of Nakamura Ching's manga *Gunjou,* I believe that the movie was an attempt at portraying sapphic women beyond romantic relationships.

Was that attempt successful? Perhaps not.

However, *Gunjou* was written by a sapphic mangaka about her own experiences. It is categorized as a non-moe yuri manga, meaning that *Gunjou*'s character designs and themes lean more towards an older audience. 

Although I usually read the original story before watching its adaptations, I will be doing it backwards, reading *Gunjou* after watching *Ride or Die*. ^^
